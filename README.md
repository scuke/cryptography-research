  Data confidentiality is a common practice today in the cyber security space. There are even laws to protect it. This means that there are people always finding new ways to protect data and people finding new ways to steal 
  
data. Cryptography is one of the best defenses we have against threats right now it Is vital in cybersecurity. Cryptography is the process of hiding information making it unreadable or it can be the other side of things 

trying to crack the code. Information that is plain text or readable is converted into cipher text (unreadable) and can usually only be read with a key.

  Protocols are used to provide secure connections, enabling two parties to communicate privately. two parties will agree on a key. Keys can be asymmetric which means they require two different keys one public and one 
  
private. Symmetric keys both use one key to decrypt and encrypt. Asymmetric is more secure but symmetric can be faster and is used for large amounts of data. According to cryptomathic.com "The main advantage of symmetric 

encryption over asymmetric encryption is that it is fast and efficient for large amounts of data; the disadvantage is the need to keep the key secret". 
  
  SSL/TLS, stands for secure socket layer protocol, and transport layer security protocol is commonly used for transfer between websites and systems. This is a widely used and trusted protocol. Protocols offer 
  
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. There is also the SSH protocol. It's a method for securely sending commands to a computer over a network. This is used for management.

  A hash is used to prove data integrity, it can be examined to prove that data has been tampered with if it differs from the expected hash. This is backed up by The SSL Store, which says, " hashing is a way to ensure that 
  
any data you send reaches your recipient in the same condition that it left you, completely intact and unaltered." One very small input can change it completely. Hash is just a unique identification for data or a file, it 

also converts plain text into cipher text. It uses algorithms like SHA-256 which is the most widely trusted to hash the data. Algorithms like MD5 were once considered uncrackable but with growing threats, it is now easily 

cracked which shows that cyber security is still growing and what we consider safe now can definitely change in the future.

  Without these protocols, sensitive information would be vulnerable. This is essential for upholding the CIA triad. Cryptography is a key ingredient to cybersecurity and is used everywhere.
